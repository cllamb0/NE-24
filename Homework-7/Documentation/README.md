### Documentation
Included in this folder is some example code that will be used in conjunction with Doxygen to test the different levels of documentation.

* documentation.ipynb:
An ipython/jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to Doxygen and Documentation
* EstNumJellies.py: An overall code for the estimation of the number of Jelly Beans in the world
* ExampleJellyInput.py: A separate Python file that is used as an example run of the EstNumJellies file
* JB-doc-example.txt: Both this file and the next file are example Doxygen codes that show the immensity of the actual Doxygen codes.
* ML-doc-example: See above
* multilevel_solver.py: This code is a simple simulation of creation of a grid w/ cross sections and scattering cross secitons
