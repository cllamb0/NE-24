%Bulk of the Abstract
Following trend of Moore's Law, computers have been growing at a constant rate since their inception. Thus the amount of storage needed to house all this information has also increased at a near identical rate. Along with these increases in storage need comes the need for increased security of that stored information and FreedomBox is an open source way to store your information. FreedomBox is a way for consumers to reliably store whatever information they need, it takes away the outside companies and allows the user to take full control of their personal data. Plinth is a software that goes with FreedomBox to help the user with setting up their personal cloud storage. Plinth allows the user operation to possibly be as simple as the operation of a smartphone.
